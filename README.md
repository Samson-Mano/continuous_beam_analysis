# Continuous Beam Analyzer

The Continuous Beam Analyzer is a program designed to solve indeterminate continuous beams subjected to various loads, including point loads, uniformly varying loads, and moments. This powerful tool enables users to analyze the behavior of continuous beams and obtain important structural parameters such as deflection, bending moment, and shear force.

## Key Features

- **Indeterminate Beam Analysis:** The program is specifically designed to handle indeterminate continuous beams, allowing for the analysis of beams with multiple spans and supports.

- **Load Types:** Users can apply different types of loads to the continuous beam, including point loads, uniformly varying loads, and moments. This feature allows for the consideration of a wide range of load scenarios.

- **Deflection Calculation:** The program calculates the deflection of the continuous beam, providing insights into the beam's flexural behavior and potential areas of concern.

- **Bending Moment and Shear Force Analysis:** Users can obtain the bending moment and shear force diagrams along the length of the continuous beam. This information helps to identify critical locations and assess structural integrity.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy to define beam properties, input loads, and obtain analysis results.

- **Visualization of Results:** The program provides visual representations of deflection, bending moment, and shear force diagrams, allowing users to visualize and interpret the structural response.
